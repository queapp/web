  <h1>Yea, IoT Controllers already exist. But this is better.</h1>
  <p>
    Que is better than the average Internet of Things controller. With Que, anything with
    an API can become a thing - this means many of the internet-connected products you use everyday including
    <a href="http://nest.com">Nest</a>, <a href="http://lono.io">Lono</a>, or <a href="http://spark.io">Spark</a>
    and anything you make yourself can <span>easily be connected and working in a short period of time</span>, so you
    don't have to pull out your hair doing something that should be easy.

  <h1>Just say what you want, Que is listening</h1>
  <p>
    Que is listening to what you say - all you have to do is click the microphone,
    and talk. Que will then perform your query, doing what ever you ask. And unlike
    other systems, there is no pattern or rule to conform to - Que supports <span>natural
    language</span>, which allows you speak what you want, unimpeaded.

        Que and Spark are the best way to automate your next project. With Que, your spark instantly has a ready-to-use
        dashboard. <span>It doesn't even require any programming</span> to get started - both on the spark and within Que. Just follow
        a simple wizard to link Que and the spark. And also, if you know some programming, your spark gains a simple javascript
        api that's functional within the browser. More information about setting up a spark can be found
        <a href="/docs/addspark">here</a>.

      <h2>Unify all your devices with one app</h2>
      <p>
        Why does it make sense to control all of your devices, each from a seperate place?
        Que lets all connected devices be on one screen, for ease of access.
